# Khelldon - Welcome to Canada Style Biomes
This modlet changes all the biomes into different kinds of snow biomes like in my alpha 15 mod "Welcome to Canada 2"
Though this does change all biomes to winter I've left many of the resources intact. Of course not the desert resources such as yucca as it makes no sense for them to be growing in the snow. You can still find oilshale in the desert biome.

Changes
- Spawn in with a set of warm clothes.
- All main water sources are now Ice. Lakes, Rivers, Oceans are ice. This does not include POI with water as those blocks are part of each indiviual POI.
- Forest biome is the most mild of the winter biomes and simliar to the vanilla snow biome. 
- Desert biome 
- Snow biome
- Wasteland Biome is the most harsh of all environments with constant storms and terrible enemies
